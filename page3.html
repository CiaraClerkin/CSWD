					<!--https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp!-->
					<strong>Primary Ability</strong>
					<br><br>
					For Ai.Mi's primary ability, she launches a circle projectile that grows bigger as it keeps moving.

This move deals medium damage.

					Her secondary move allows her to teleport and deal an heavy attack to enemies she comes into contact with. <!--core?!-->
					<br><br>
					<strong>Special Ability</strong>
					<br><br>
					Ai.Mi's special move allows her to place a turret which can knock back and damage enemies and hit the core in the straight line it goes in.

				<img src = "styles/images/Era.png" class = "profile">
				<p>
					Era is a shy mage who is best at supporting her teammates. 
					<br><br>
					Era's primary ability is a beam that, when hits enemies, deals a light hit and they are debuffed, which reduces their size (the range at which they can hit the core with no abilities) and power (abilities have less of an impact).
					<br><br>
					Era's secondary ability gives her teammates a 40% speed buff, which runs out over 2.5 seconds.
					<br><br>
					Era's special ability creates a projectile that charges up to become bigger and stronger over time. You can release it before it fully charges, but it will deal light hits.

				<p>
					Juno is a friendly slime alien who uses her blobbles to redirect the core and damage enemies!
					<br><br>
					Juno's primary move shoots one of her blobbles. If it hits the core, it knocks it away faster than hitting it normally, and the blobble stays for a bit. If the core is hit into the blobble, it bursts and sends it moving.
					<br><br>
					Juno's secondary move makes her jump on one of her blobbles to travel and leaves it behind her. If the core is hit into the blobble, it bursts and sends it moving.
					<br><br>
					Juno's special move places all of her remaining blobbles down.

			<h2>Luna</h2>

				<p>
					Luna is a chaotic child inventor who uses rockets she invented to blast away the competition! 
					Luna is best at controlling the match from afar, so she is quite difficult to play, as you need to predict where your opponents and the core will be and time your moves right to get the most out of using her.
					<br><br>
					Luna's primary move launches a rocket. This rocket is more powerful the further it goes, so it's best to use it to hit enemies or the core from afar.
					<br><br>
					With Luna's secondary move, she rides one of her rockets until she hits someone or something. This move is also more powerful the further away it's used.
					<br><br>
					Luna's special is a missile strike from the air. She can place it up to a distance of about half of the map from where she is standing. The move has 2 zones within, the one in the middle deals high damage and the outer zone deals less damage. Opponents will not be hurt if they are not within the zones.
