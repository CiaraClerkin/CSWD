			<h2>Movement Controls</h2>

				<p> 
					<!--The core is the ball in Omega Strikers. 
					You can hit the core with your primary move or with any of your characters' special abilities. 
					The primary move is set to click by default.!-->
					The best control scheme to use right now for all of the characters is mouse and keyboard, especially WASD instead of MOBA controls. 
					The game has WASD controls by default, you can change them in the settings. 
					<br><br>
					With WASD, you move with the W, A, S, and D keys on the keyboard, they're like the arrow keys but for your left hand. It's best to use 3 fingers, the middle one being on w, and one on a and the other on d. That way, you'll only need to move your middle finger up and down to hit w and s.
					<br><br>
					With MOBA controls, you move by clicking where you want to go with the mouse. 
					This can make it more difficult to hit the core and use your moves accurately.
					<br><br>
					The game works with a controller, but it can be difficult to use with certain characters. 
					I recommend trying out controller with the characters you want to play in unranked to see how it works for you.

				<p> 
					Every character has four abilities in total: hit the core normally, primary, secondary and special. 
					<br><br>
					The buttons you need to press to do these can be changed in the settings, and, when you're in a match, you can see what buttons you need to press to do each move in the bottom left corner, and you can hover with your mouse to see the description of each move.
					<br><br>
					You can also look there to see when you can use your abilities. Each ability has a cooldown, which means that after you use it, you'll have to wait a certain length of time to use it again.

			<h2>Hitting the Core</h2>
			<div class = "flex">
				<!--The footage belongs to Mogz on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zydwhdeseuI!-->
				<p>
					The core is the ball in Omega Strikers. Move the mouse to aim where you want the core to go.
					<br><br>
					You can use your character's abilities to hit the core. As seen in the gif, Estelle is aiming her primary ability by holding her move's button down while moving the mouse.
					<br><br>
					The distance at which you can hit the core normally is bigger than you think! Try hitting it when it's nearby!
					<br><br>
					Avoid sending the core to your opponents!
					<br><br>
					Pass the core to your teammates, this is a team game!
					<br><br>
					Don't just chase the core. Remember, the core will bounce off walls, try to predict where the ball will be. You can use this to your advantage!

				<p>
					You can die and kill in this game.  
					<br><br>
					Try to stay away from the edge of the map and even the edge of inside the goals because if you get hit you will die instantly.
					<br><br>
					If you get attacked enough times, you gain something called "stagger". Stagger makes you extremely easy to get launched into the edge of the map and die.
					<br><br>
					Make sure to collect orbs, they give you health / remove stagger and a power-up that changes each game. You can see what the power-up is in the top left when you're selecting your characters at the start of the match.

			<h2>Forwards, Goalies and Flex</h2>
			<div class = "flex">
				<p>
					You can change your role by pressing the button above play. By default, your role is flex, which means that the game chooses your role for you depending on what your teammates have chosen, either Forward or Goalie. 
					<br><br>
					Forward: The main role of the Forward is to score goals for the team.
					<br><br>
					Goalie: The main role of the Goalie is to prevent the core from going into the net.
					<br><br>
					These points may seem obvious, but they are very important. 
					<br><br>
					Try to let your Goalie defend the net because more players at the net can make it more difficult to keep the ball away. Try to remain open to be passed to instead.
					<br><br>
					Of course, priorities can change, for example, if you're a Forward and your Goalie dies, you or your teammate should try to defend the net to prevent the enemy from getting an easy goal.
